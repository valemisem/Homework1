## git pull 
- Brings the copy of all the changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch
- The local repository is updated directly
- Updates the changes to the local repository immediately

## git fetch
- Gives the information of a new change from a remote repository without merging into the current branch
- Review of commits and changes can be done
- No possibility of merge conflicts
